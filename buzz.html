    <p class="lead mb-5">
      Buzz is a social media platform I built as my first real side project during the first year of my Java Developer studies. My goal was simply to create a fully functional application with real-time messaging, posts, likes, and follows. I didn’t set a deadline—it was all about getting hands-on experience and learning.
    </p>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <section id="purpose" class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Purpose of the project</h2>
      <p>
        Buzz was my first solo full-stack adventure with Spring Boot and React during my Java Developer studies. I set out to build a complete social media app from scratch—designing RESTful APIs, integrating a MySQL database, and crafting a dynamic React UI with real-time messaging. My goal was to get hands-on experience at every layer of development, master basic Git workflows, and understand what it takes to ship a fully functional web application end-to-end.
      </p>

    <!-- The process -->
    <section id="process" class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-2">The process</h2>
      <p>
        Since this was my first Spring Boot/React project, getting the basic structure up and running took a bit of trial and error. I kicked things off on the backend by sketching out a to-do list—tasks like “initial REST API,” “database integration,” “MySQL CRUD operations,” and so on. For each item, I spun up a dedicated Git branch, knocked it out, then merged back into <code>main</code> once everything was working. This kept my workflow tidy and helped me build confidence with branching and merging early on!

      <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Problems</h2>
      <p>
        Diving in solo meant I quickly ran into a handful of gotchas. Wiring up Spring Boot and React took more trial and error than I expected—dependency mismatches, CORS errors, and forgetting a <code>@CrossOrigin</code> annotation here and there. A typo in my <code>application.properties</code> once prevented the app from starting altogether, and a missing MySQL table silently broke my CRUD endpoints. Each hiccup forced me to dig into logs, reconfigure, and try again until everything clicked.

    <!-- Lessons learned -->
    <section id="lessons" class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Lessons learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan your API contracts before you code:</strong> Sketching endpoints and data models on paper saved me hours later.</li>
        <li><strong>Branch early and often:</strong> Isolating each feature in its own branch made merges predictable and rollbacks painless.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the docs (really!):</strong> Spring Boot’s auto-configuration is powerful, but only if you understand what it’s doing under the hood.</li>
        <li><strong>Automate tests early:</strong> A few simple integration tests caught regressions before they hit production.</li>
        <li><strong>Embrace errors:</strong> Every bug taught me something new—never shy away from diving into stack traces and logs.</li>
      </ul>
