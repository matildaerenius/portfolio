            <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Why I built Recipedia</h2>
            <hr class="section-underline" />
            <p>
              Recipedia started with a very real-life problem: me, standing in
              front of the fridge, holding a half-used zucchini and wondering
              what on earth I could make for dinner. I figured, "Why not build
              an application that helps me figure that out?" The idea was
              simple: track what ingredients I already have at home and suggest
              recipes based on that. No more endless Googling or throwing out
              forgotten leftovers.
              <br />
              <br />
              I wanted it to feel like a smart little kitchen buddy - one that
              not only finds matching recipes but also shows what I’m almost
              able to cook, so I’d only need to buy one or two things, not a
              full cart of groceries. I was also inspired by a hackathon video I
              stumbled across where a team had built something similar. That
              gave me the nudge to try building my own version from scratch,
              using the tech stack I’d been practicing. It turned into a really
              fun (and delicious) way to level up my coding skills while solving
              a real problem I face pretty much every evening.

            <h2 class="h4 mb-2">The process</h2>
            <hr class="section-underline" />
            <p>
              I kicked things off by setting up a basic Spring Boot
              backend—nothing fancy, just some classic REST endpoints and a
              MySQL database to hold my kitchen “inventory.” I wanted the user
              to be able to add and remove ingredients easily, so I kept the
              backend clean and straightforward. Once that was rolling, I jumped
              into the frontend with React and built a minimal UI where users
              could check off ingredients they had. I hooked it up to a recipe
              API that returned suggestions based on those inputs. The goal was
              to keep it fast, clean, and actually useful. I didn’t want bells
              and whistles—just a solid helper app that could answer “What’s for
              dinner?” To top it off, I added login functionality so users could
              save their ingredient lists. Because let’s face it, no one wants
              to re-enter “pasta, ketchup, and cheese” every single time.
            </p>

          <section id="problems" class="mb-6" data-aos="fade-left">
            <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Problems</h2>
            <hr class="section-underline" />
            <p>
              First off: recipe APIs are picky. Some had limits, some wanted
              money, and some returned... weird suggestions (like “tuna
              smoothie,” no thanks). Also, getting the matching logic right was
              trickier than expected. At one point, it kept recommending recipes
              that needed one ingredient I definitely didn’t have: “anchovies.”
              I don’t even like anchovies. Frontend state management also caused
              some chaos. I’d forget to update the UI when ingredients were
              removed, so it kept suggesting recipes for stuff that no longer
              existed in my fridge. Classic. But every bug, API hiccup, or
              design decision taught me something—from better error handling to
              making smarter queries, to appreciating how real apps think like
              real users (even if they don’t like anchovies either).

            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>
                <strong>Start small, then spice it up:</strong> Trying to build
                everything at once is like throwing all your spices into a pot
                and hoping for the best. Starting with basic CRUD and gradually
                layering in features made everything easier to manage (and
                actually work).
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>APIs are not always your friend:</strong> Some APIs play
                nice. Others ghost you, rate-limit you, or send you recipe
                suggestions that make you question humanity. Always read the
                fine print and test thoroughly.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>UX matters, even for dinner apps:</strong> Just because
                it’s a utility doesn’t mean it has to look boring. Making the UI
                simple, responsive, and nice to use actually made me more
                motivated to keep improving the project.
