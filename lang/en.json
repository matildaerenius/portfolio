    "title": "About me",
    "paragraph1": "Hey! I'm Matilda, currently based in Stockholm and studying to become a Java developer. I didn’t grow up coding in my bedroom or building websites at age 12. Nope, I came into tech with zero experience, just a big curiosity and a love for solving tricky stuff. Fast forward to today, and I’m completely hooked, constantly excited to dive into new puzzles and expand my tech skills.",
    "paragraph2": "As of right now, I’ve found myself especially drawn to backend development. There’s something really satisfying about making things work behind the scenes — the logic, the structure, the flow. I'm also super eager to explore cloud technologies and figure out how all those moving parts come together in real-world applications.",
    "paragraph3": "I try to approach both life and code with curiosity, humor, and the mindset that every “oops” is just a disguised learning moment. I'm always up for a new challenge, especially if it involves tech, teamwork, or a really good Spotify playlist.",
    "paragraph4": "Furthermore, when I'm not glued to my computer, you'll find me lifting weights or out on a long walk - then getting too tired and catching the bus back. I love a good board game night with family or friends (even though I lose about nine out of ten times - hey, at least I'm lucky in love). Otherwise, I'm probably scrubbing the oven, reorganizing the kitchen cabinet, which I find oddly therapeutic. When I need a break you'll find me rewatching Friends for the 11th time - always with a stash of lollies, of course.",
